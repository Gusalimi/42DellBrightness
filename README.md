# 42DellBrightness
Two scripts to change the brightness of the Dells PC.

## Usage
Add the execution rights to the files with `chmod +x brightnessUp brightnessDown`

You can then put them in `~/.local/bin` and add `export PATH="$PATH:/home/login/.local/bin"` to your `.zshrc` to be able to call `brightnessUp` and `brightnessDown` from the terminal.

You can also add a shortcut through the settings. It doesn't work with the real brightness up and down keys but it works with F1 and F2.
